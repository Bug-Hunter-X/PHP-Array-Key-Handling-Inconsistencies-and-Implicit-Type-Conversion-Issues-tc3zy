In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not strictly integers.  Consider this scenario:

```php
<?php
$myArray = array("a" => 1, "b" => 2, 0 => 3);
foreach ($myArray as $key => $value) {
    echo "Key: " . $key . ", Value: " . $value . "\n";
}
?>
```

The output might be surprising. PHP's internal array handling is not consistent when mixing string and integer keys. It might prioritize integer keys, potentially leading to unexpected order or key overwrites.  The order in which keys are processed (a, b, 0) is not guaranteed.

Another issue stems from relying on implicit type conversion. If you attempt arithmetic operations on array keys expecting them to be integers, and they're not, you'll run into type juggling issues that can generate unpredictable results.
