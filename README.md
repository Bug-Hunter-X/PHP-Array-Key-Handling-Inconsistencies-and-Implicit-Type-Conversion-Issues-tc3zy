# PHP Array Key Handling and Type Juggling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in PHP related to array key handling and implicit type conversion.  The bug arises from the interaction of string and integer keys within arrays and unexpected behavior during arithmetic operations on array keys that are not strictly integers.

## Bug Description
PHP's handling of array keys that are a mix of strings and integers can be inconsistent.  The order in which elements are processed is not always guaranteed, which can lead to unexpected results. Additionally, relying on implicit type conversion during calculations involving array keys can cause further unpredictable behavior.

## Solution
The solution focuses on using consistent key types (all integers or all strings), and explicitly converting keys to integers before any arithmetic operations.  Clear, explicit type handling prevents unexpected behavior stemming from PHP's type juggling mechanisms.
