The solution involves ensuring consistent key types and using explicit type conversions:

```php
<?php
$myArray = array(0 => 1, 1 => 2, 2 => 3); //Consistent integer keys
foreach ($myArray as $key => $value) {
    echo "Key: " . $key . ", Value: " . $value . "\n";
}

$myArray2 = array("a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c" => 3); // Consistent string keys
foreach ($myArray2 as $key => $value) {
    echo "Key: " . $key . ", Value: " . $value . "\n";
}

//Avoid implicit type conversion
$key = "1";
$newKey = (int)$key + 1; //Explicit type casting before arithmetic
echo "New Key: " . $newKey;
?>
```
This version uses either all integers or all strings for array keys, eliminating the ambiguity.  Additionally, any arithmetic operations on keys now explicitly cast the keys to integers to prevent PHP's implicit type conversion from causing problems.
